This project **introduced fundamental network protocols and how they are analyzed in Wireshark**, highlighting their significance in **cybersecurity monitoring and incident response**.  

ðŸ”¹ **ICMP analysis** helps detect **network scanning, availability issues, and potential DoS attacks**.  
ðŸ”¹ **DNS inspection** is critical for identifying **malware activity, exfiltration attempts, and domain hijacking**.  
ðŸ”¹ **TLS analysis** ensures **secure encrypted communications and helps identify weak encryption practices**.  

âœ… **Wireshark is an invaluable tool in cybersecurity, used for traffic analysis, forensic investigations, and security assessments.** This introductory project laid the groundwork for deeper exploration into **packet analysis, encrypted traffic inspection, and intrusion detection**.  

#### ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps:** Future projects may explore advanced topics such as **malware traffic analysis, intrusion detection system (IDS) integration, and encrypted payload decryption techniques.**

    "After confirming successful ICMP Echo Request and Reply exchanges in the command line, we applied an ICMP filter in Wireshark to perform a more detailed analysis of individual packets. This allows us to inspect network traffic at a granular level, verifying the structure and behavior of the packets in real-time. Frame 131018, an ICMP Echo Request sent to Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8), was selected for analysis to examine the underlying details, including source and destination IP addresses, MAC addresses, checksum validation, sequence numbers, and response mapping. This step is crucial in cybersecurity for understanding network behavior, detecting anomalies, and validating expected traffic patterns, as attackers often manipulate ICMP for reconnaissance, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or network probing. By studying this frame, we gain deeper insights into how ICMP operates and how legitimate vs. malicious network traffic can be distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our initial ping 8.8.8.8 -n 4 command only sent four ICMP Echo Requests, the network traffic captured in Wireshark includes significantly more data because Wireshark records all activity on the selected network interface, not just the specific packets we initiated. This includes background network processes, additional ICMP messages, router responses, and potentially other devices on the same network generating traffic. Additionally, multiple ICMP-related frames can appear due to packet fragmentation, retries, and responses from intermediate routers. For example, if a router along the path drops a packet due to a TTL limit, it may generate an ICMP Time Exceeded message, which also appears in Wireshark. This high volume of related data is expected in live network captures and highlights why cybersecurity professionals must use filters and careful analysis to isolate relevant packets when investigating network behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ TLS 1.3 Handshake: Efficient and Secure\n",
    "Faster: Fewer round trips improve connection speed. The client sends key share values immediately in the Client Hello, allowing key exchange in one round trip instead of two.\n",
    "More Secure: Enforces forward secrecy, meaning past communications cannot be decrypted even if future encryption keys are compromised. Removes insecure cryptographic functions (e.g., static RSA key exchange, SHA-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Session Resumption with PSK (Pre-Shared Key):\n",
    "Purpose: If the client previously connected, it can skip the full handshake and resume securely using a pre-shared key (PSK).\n",
    "Benefit: Reduces overhead, improving performance and latency (especially useful for mobile or frequently reconnected devices).\n",
    "How It Works: The server issues a session ticket after the first connection, which the client presents when reconnecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Elliptic Curve Cryptography (X25519) for Key Exchange:\n",
    "What It Does: Securely establishes a shared secret between client and server via Diffie-Hellman key exchange without exposing the key in transit.\n",
    "Why X25519? It’s a widely adopted elliptic curve that provides strong security with excellent performance (faster than older Diffie-Hellman methods).\n",
    "Key Share Extension: Used in TLS 1.3 for securely sharing public keys as part of the handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ TLS 1.3 Eliminates Weak Encryption:\n",
    "Legacy methods removed:\n",
    "❌ RSA key exchange (lacked forward secrecy).\n",
    "❌ SHA-1 hashing algorithm (prone to collisions).\n",
    "Only secure cipher suites allowed:\n",
    "Example: AES-GCM and ChaCha20 (authenticated encryption with integrity protection).\n",
    "Why It Matters: Mitigates downgrade attacks and prevents attackers from exploiting older, weaker algorithms.\n",
